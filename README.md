# ITAI1378 ‚Äì AI and Image Processing Projects

This repository contains assignments, labs, and notebooks completed during the ITAI1378 course. Each module explores a different aspect of computer vision, including pixel representation, color models, neural networks, and object detection.

## üìÅ Folder Structure
- **Module01_GitHub_Colab_Intro:** Introduction to GitHub and Google Colab.
- **Module02_Pixels_ColorModels:** Overview of pixels and RGB, HSV, CMYK color models.
- **Module03_SVM_Classification:** Image classification using Support Vector Machines.
- **Module04_Neural_Networks:** Neural network structure, activation functions, and tuning.
- **Module05_Image_Classification:** Model troubleshooting and image classification refinement.
- **Module06_Edge_Detection:** Exploring vertical and horizontal edge detection using filters.
- **Module07_Object_Detection:** Object detection with SSD MobileNetV2 and a summary cheat sheet.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks used for experimentation and model building.
- **Timeline_Project:** Presentation material highlighting the development of computer vision topics.
